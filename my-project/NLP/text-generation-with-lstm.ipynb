intelligence ai in its broadest sense is intelligence exhibited by machines particularly computer systems it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals such machines may be called ais\nai technology is widely used throughout industry government and science some highprofile applications include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix interacting via human speech eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore\nalan turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 the field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winter funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous ai techniques and after 2017 with the transformer architecture this led to the ai boom of the early 2020s with companies universities and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the united states pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence\nthe growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation datadriven decisionmaking and the integration of ai systems into various economic sectors and areas of life impacting job markets healthcare government industry and education this raises questions about the longterm effects ethical implications and risks of ai prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology \nthe various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics general intelligencethe ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals\nto reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields\n\ngoals\nthe general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research\n\nreasoning and problemsolving\nearly researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics\nmany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem\n\nknowledge representation\nknowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas\na knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge\namong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications\n\nplanning and decisionmaking\nan agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility\nin classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked\nin some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be\na markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned\ngame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents\n\nlearning\nmachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning\nthere are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input\nin reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning\ncomputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization\n\nnatural language processing\nnatural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering\nearly work based on noam chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure\nmodern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in 2019 generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by 2023 these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications\n\nperception\nmachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input\nthe field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition and robotic perception\n\nsocial intelligence\naffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction\nhowever this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject\n\ngeneral intelligence\na machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence\n\ntechniques\nai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above\n\nsearch and optimization\nai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search\n\nstate space search\nstate space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis\nsimple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal\nadversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position\n\nlocal search\nlocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally\ngradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks\nanother type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation\ndistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails\n\nlogic\nformal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation\nformal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys\ndeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules\ngiven a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved\ninference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages\nfuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1 it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true\nnonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning\nother specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains\n\nprobabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\nmany problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design\nbayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks\n\nprobabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters\n\nclassifiers and statistical learning methods\nthe simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience\nthere are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid1990s and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s\nthe naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability\nneural networks are also used as classifiers\n\nartificial neural networks\nan artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers\nlearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm\nneural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function\nin feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks\nperceptrons\nuse only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers\nconvolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object\n\ndeep learning\ndeep learning\nuses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces\ndeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023\nthe sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the 1950s\nbut because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet\n\ngpt\ngenerative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences natural language processing textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet the pretraining consists in predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf current gpt models are still prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data they are used in chatbots which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text\ncurrent models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text\n\nspecialized hardware and software\nin the late 2010s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training historically specialized languages such as lisp prolog python and others had been used\n\napplications\nai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and selfdriving cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apples face id or microsofts deepface and googles facenet and image labeling used by facebook apples iphoto and tiktok\n\nhealth and medicine\nthe application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients\nfor medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways for example alphafold 2 2021 demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the 3d structure of a protein in 2023 it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria in 2024 researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold\n\ngames\ngame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test ais most advanced techniques deep blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on 11 may 1997 in 2011 in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibms question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin in march 2016 alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer goplaying system to beat a professional go player without handicaps then in 2017 it defeated ke jie who was the best go player in the world other programs handle imperfectinformation games such as the pokerplaying program pluribus deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with muzero which could be trained to play chess go or atari games in 2019 deepminds alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map in 2021 an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition winning against four of the worlds best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning\n\nmilitary\nvarious countries are deploying ai military applications the main applications enhance command and control communications sensors integration and interoperability research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams ai was incorporated into military operations in iraq and syria\nin november 2023 us vice president kamala harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of ai the commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military ai with international laws and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology\n\ngenerative ai\nin the early 2020s generative ai gained widespread prominence in march 2023 58 of us adults had heard about chatgpt and 14 had tried it the increasing realism and easeofuse of aibased texttoimage generators such as midjourney dalle and stable diffusion sparked a trend of viral aigenerated photos widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of pope francis wearing a white puffer coat the fictional arrest of donald trump and a hoax of an attack on the pentagon as well as the usage in professional creative arts\n\nindustryspecific tasks\nthere are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions in a 2017 survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management\nin agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield agronomists use ai to conduct research and development ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water\nartificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights for example for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy it could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration including analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation\n\nethics\nai has potential benefits and potential risks ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deep mind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning\n\nrisks and harm\nprivacy and copyright\nmachinelearning algorithms require large amounts of data the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright\ntechnology companies collect a wide range of data from their users including online activity geolocation data video and audio\nfor example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy\nai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy since 2016 some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it\ngenerative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robotstxt file in 2023 leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors\n\nmisinformation\nyoutube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society after the us election in 2016 major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem\nin 2022 generative ai began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks\n\nalgorithmic bias and fairness\nmachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data the developers may not be aware that the bias exists\nbias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination\nfairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias it has become serious area of academic study within ai researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define fairness in a way that satisfies all stakeholders\non june 28 2015 google photoss new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla eight years later in 2023 google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon\ncompas is a commercial program widely used by us courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist\nin 2016 julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61 the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend in 2017 several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data\na program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender\nmoritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work\ncriticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive\nbias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about 4 are black and 20 are women\nat its 2022 conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct 2022 the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed\n\nlack of transparency\nmany ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs but some popular explainability techniques exist\nit is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading\npeople who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used\ndarpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in 2014 to try and solve these problems \nthere are several possible solutions to the transparency problem shap tried to solve the transparency problems by visualising the contribution of each feature to the output lime can locally approximate a model with a simpler interpretable model multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning\n\nbad actors and weaponized ai\nartificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states\na lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in 2014 30 nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by 2015 over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots\nai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china\nthere many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours\n\nreliance on industry giants\ntraining ai systems requires an enormous amount of computing power usually only big tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments smaller startups such as cohere and openai end up buying access to data centers from google and microsoft respectively\n\ntechnological unemployment\neconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment\nin the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed risk estimates vary for example in the 2010s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated 47 of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only 9 of us jobs as high risk the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies in april 2023 it was reported that 70 of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence\nunlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in 2015 that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy\nfrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement\n\nexistential risk\nit has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways\nfirst ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side\nsecond yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk the essential parts of civilization are not physical things like ideologies law government money and the economy are made of language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive\nthe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk have expressed concern about existential risk from ai\nai pioneers including feifei li geoffrey hinton yoshua bengio cynthia breazeal rana el kaliouby demis hassabis joy buolamwini and sam altman have expressed concerns about the risks of ai in 2023 many leading ai experts issued the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\nother researchers however spoke in favor of a less dystopian view ai pioneer juergen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in 95 of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction in the early 2010s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine however after 2016 the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research\n\nethical machines and alignment\nfriendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk\nmachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas\nthe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality\nand was founded at an aaai symposium in 2005\nother approaches include wendell wallachs artificial moral agents and stuart j russells three principles for developing provably beneficial machines\n\nopen source\nactive organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta various ai models such as llama 2 mistral or stable diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they cant be deleted everywhere if needed they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses\n\nframeworks\nartificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an ai system an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum valuesdeveloped by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas\n\nrespect the dignity of individual people\nconnect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively\ncare for the wellbeing of everyone\nprotect social values justice and the public interest\nother developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles do not go without their criticisms especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks\npromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers\nthe ai safety institute in the uk has released a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under a mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities\n\nregulation\nthe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally according to ai index at stanford the annual number of airelated laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone between 2016 and 2020 more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates us and vietnam others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june 2020 stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate ai in 2023 openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than 10 years in 2023 the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics\nin a 2022 ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country 78 of chinese citizens but only 35 of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks a 2023 reutersipsos poll found that 61 of americans agree and 22 disagree that ai poses risks to humanity in a 2023 fox news poll 35 of americans thought it very important and an additional 41 thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus 13 responding not very important and 8 responding not at all important\nin november 2023 the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks 28 countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence\n\nhistory\nthe study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain \nthey developed several areas of research that would become part of ai\nsuch as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in 1943 and turings influential 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible\nthe field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in 1956 the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the 1960s they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and us universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s\nresearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation  the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem in 1974 both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects minskys and paperts book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed\nin the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began\nup to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts in the 1980s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others in 1990 yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks\nai gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by 2000 solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the 1990s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence\nhowever several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around 2002 they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the 2010s\ndeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field\nfor many specific tasks other methods were abandoned\ndeep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by 50 in the years 20152019\nin 2016 issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study\nin the late teens and early 2020s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest in 2015 alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player the program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself gpt3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions in ai research according to ai impacts about 50 billion annually was invested in ai around 2022 in the us alone and about 20 of the new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai\nabout 800000 airelated us job openings existed in 2022\n\nphilosophy\ndefining artificial intelligence\nalan turing wrote in 1950 i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\nrussell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence\nmccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible\nanother definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence\n\nevaluating approaches to ai\nno established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers\n\nsymbolic ai and its limits\nsymbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests in the 1960s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action\nhowever the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him\nthe issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches\n\nneat vs scruffy\nneats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work this issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s but eventually was seen as irrelevant modern ai has elements of both\n\nsoft vs hard computing\nfinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful ai programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks\n\nnarrow vs general ai\nai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions the experimental subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively\n\nmachine consciousness sentience and mind\nthe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction\n\nconsciousness\ndavid chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like\n\ncomputationalism and functionalism\ncomputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam\nphilosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind\n\nai welfare and rights\nit is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for ai rights robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society\nin 2017 the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own\nprogress in ai increased interest in the topic proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited\n\nfuture\nsuperintelligence and the singularity\na superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind\nif research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i j good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity\nhowever technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do\n\ntranshumanism\nrobot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger\nedward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butlers darwin among the machines as far back as 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998\n\nin fiction\nthoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction\na common trope in these works began with mary shelleys frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarkes and stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey both 1968 with hal 9000 the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator 1984 and the matrix 1999 in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still 1951 and bishop from aliens 1986 are less prominent in popular culture\nisaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories most notably the multivac series about a superintelligent computer of the same name asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity\nseveral works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel čapeks rur the films ai artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence\n\nsee also\nartificial intelligence detection software  software to detect aigenerated contentpages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nbehavior
